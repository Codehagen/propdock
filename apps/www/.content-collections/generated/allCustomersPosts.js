It currently has ~1.5M weekly NPM downloads and is used by millions of developers around the world.\n\nIn fact, Dub itself uses the Prisma ORM under the hood to handle database queries and migrations – here is our [Prisma Schema](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/blob/main/prisma/schema.prisma) file, fully open-source as well!\n\nWith [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate) and [Prisma Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/pulse), Prisma is also providing new tools to build modern applications with great developer experience.\n\n## The challenge: Managing and tracking 250+ short links\n\nEarlier this month, [Petra](https://twitter.com/petradonka) from the Prisma team reached out with one simple request – they wanted to migrate their existing `pris.ly` short links to Dub.\n\nFor context, `pris.ly` links were used in their various online communications, as well as the Prisma ORM to link to documentation and other resources. For example, the following link in the default Prisma schema would redirect to the [Prisma Schema docs page](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema):\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Example of a pris.ly link used in Prisma Schema\"\n  src=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-schema.png\"\n  width={1310}\n  height={684}\n/>\n\nIn the past, Prisma used a [custom-built solution](https://github.com/prisma/pris.ly) to handle short links. However, this solution was not ideal for a few reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of analytics**: There was no way to track which links were clicked on the most, or where the clicks were coming from.\n2. **Potential for link conflicts**: As the number of links grew, it became increasingly difficult to ensure that each link was unique.\n3. **Complicated UX and slow updates**: To add a new link, a user would have to create a new [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the GitHub repository, merge it, and wait ~10 seconds for the new link to be deployed.\n\n<Quote\n  author=\"Petra Donka\"\n  authorSrc=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-petra.png\"\n  title=\"Head of Developer Connections\"\n  company=\"Prisma\"\n  companySrc=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-logo.png\"\n  text=\"We wanted something that not only enables everyone at Prisma to create short links easily, but also provides more analytics for those links.\"\n/>\n\n## The solution: An easy-to-use link management tool with built-in analytics\n\nDub was the perfect solution for Prisma's use case – given its ease of use and powerful analytics.\n\nIn less than a day, Prisma was able to migrate all 250+ of their existing `pris.ly` links to Dub, and the value prop was clear from the start:\n\n1. **Analytics on each link**: Dub provides detailed analytics on each link, including the number of clicks over time, location data, device data, and more.\n2. **Easy to create new links**: Dub provides a simple UI to create new links, along with useful features such as [tags](/help/article/how-to-use-tags) to help organize links.\n3. **Smooth UX and instant updates**: With Dub, Prisma can now [easily create short links](/help/article/how-to-create-link) that are instantly available to use – no more waiting for 10 seconds for the link to be deployed.\n\n<Quote\n  author=\"Petra Donka\"\n  authorSrc=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-petra.png\"\n  title=\"Head of Developer Connections\"\n  company=\"Prisma\"\n  companySrc=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-logo.png\"\n  text=\"Dub is a fantastic product – the value prop was clear in just 5 mins of us going live with it, when the first short link was created.\"\n/>\n\n## The results: Smoother UX for the entire Prisma team\n\nSince migrating to Dub, Prisma has been able to quickly create new links and track the performance of each link. This gave them insight into which links are most used and how they can make even better use of those resources.\n\n<Quote\n  author=\"Marc Hess\"\n  authorSrc=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-marc.jpeg\"\n  title=\"Senior Developer Advocate\"\n  company=\"Prisma\"\n  companySrc=\"https://d2vwwcvoksz7ty.cloudfront.net/customers/prisma-logo.png\"\n  text=\"Dub makes it so much easier to quickly create links when helping users on Twitter, Slack, or Discord – as well as track the performance of those links. Really awesome product!\"\n/>\n\nAs an Enterprise customer on Dub, Prisma has also been leveraging Dub's [SAML/SSO feature](/help/category/saml-sso) to manage access to their links. This has been especially useful for Prisma, as they have been able to easily manage access to links for their entire team.",
