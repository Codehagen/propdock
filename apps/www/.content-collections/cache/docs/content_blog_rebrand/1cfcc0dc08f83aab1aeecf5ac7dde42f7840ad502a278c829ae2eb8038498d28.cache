{"content":"Today, we're thrilled to announce our rebrand. **Dub.sh is now Dub.co**.\n\nAlmost a year ago, we [launched Dub to the world](introducing-dub). Since then, we've been growing steadily and recently surpassed the following milestones:\n\n- **10,000+** users\n- **1,000+** connected custom domains\n- **30,000+** short links created\n- **7.7 million** links redirected\n- **10,000+** GitHub stars\n- Powering teams like **Vercel**, **Tinybird**, **Hashnode**, and more.\n\nWe're incredibly grateful for the support and feedback we've received from our users. Thank you for being part of our journey.\n\n## Our New Brand: Dub.co\n\nAs we grew, we realized that our existing brand, _Dub.sh_, was not ideal.\n\nWhile it was great for short links, the relatively unfamiliar `.sh` TLD has been a point of confusion for many users. We've gotten feedback that the name looked suspicious – especially to a marketer who has never seen a `.sh` domain before. Furthermore, the `.sh` TLD is [blocked in certain regions](https://x.com/jr_resonable/status/1693666704990011744), which made it difficult for some users to access Dub without a VPN.\n\nAfter months of brainstorming, we finally found the perfect name: **Dub.co**.\n\n## What's new in Dub.co?\n\nOur rebrand is more of a facelift than a complete overhaul. We're still the same Dub you know and love, but with a new domain. We will still be using `dub.sh` as the default short link domain on Dub, and all existing `dub.sh` links will continue to work as usual.\n\nAlong with our new brand, we've also been working on a multitude of new features and improvements. In the last 30 days, we rolled out 9 major updates:\n\n<Changelog before={new Date(\"2023-08-20\").toISOString()} count={9} />\n\n## What's next?\n\nWe're very excited about the future of Dub. There are several features we're working on that we can't wait to share with you – more notably, [SAML/SSO](/help/category/saml-sso) and the [official Dub API](/help/article/dub-api).\n\nDub is here to stay and we're committed to making it the best link shortener for everyone, everywhere.
