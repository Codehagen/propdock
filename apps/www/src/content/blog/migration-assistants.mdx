Today, we're excited to launch migration assistants for Bitly and Short.io to help you migrate your links to Dub in a few clicks.

## What is Dub?

Dub is the link management tool for modern marketing teams. With Dub, you can create, share, and track short links using your own custom domain.

Ever since our [launch](introducing-dub), we've received countless requests from our users to add migration assistants for other URL shorteners – more notably Bitly and Short.io.

## Why migrate to Dub?

Dub is built with the modern marketer in mind. We've built Dub to be the best link management tool for founders and marketing teams, with a sleek and intuitive interface, and powerful features like:

- **Powerful link builder**: Our [link builder](how-to-create-link) comes with features like UTM builder, device targeting, password protection, expiration dates, and more.
- **Custom domains** – With Dub, you can create short links with your own [custom domain](how-to-add-custom-domain) – free of charge – for better brand recognition.
- **Custom social media cards**: Dub is the only link management tool that lets you [customize the social media cards](how-to-create-link#custom-social-media-cards) for your links, so you can have full control over how your links look when shared on social media.
