We recently migrated all Dub's time-series analytics data from Redis to [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/).

This resulted in a ~100x reduction in request bandwidth (and a similar reduction in request speeds).

For context, Tinybird is a serverless analytical backend for you to ingest data and analyze it with SQL. Built on top of [Clickhouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse), Tinybird is incredibly scalable when it comes to storing and processing time-series events.

Expect faster load times for your link stats pages moving forward!
