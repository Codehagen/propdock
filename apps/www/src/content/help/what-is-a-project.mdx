On Dub, a "Project" is a space that you can use to store all the short links for your website, app, or business.

You can think of a Dub project as a "Team" – you can [invite your teammates](how-to-invite-teammates) to join your project and manage the links together.

## How to create a project

To create a project, go to the [Dub Dashboard](https://app.dub.co/) and click on the **Create project** button.

Here are the fields in the project creation modal:

1. **Project Name**: This is the name of your project on Dub.
2. **Project Slug**: This is your project's unique slug on Dub.
3. **Shortlink Domain**: This is the domain that your short links will be hosted on. E.g. `yourbrand.com/link`.

Once you have filled in the fields, click on the **Create project** button to create your project.

## Onboarding checklist

After you have created your project, you will be redirected to the project dashboard. Here, you will see a checklist of things that you can do to get started with your project.

1. **Configure your custom domain**: You can [configure your custom domain](how-to-add-custom-domain) to use your own domain for your short links.
2. **Create or import your links**: You can [create links](how-to-create-link) or [import existing ones](how-to-import-bitly-links) to your project.
3. **Invite your teammates**: You can [invite your teammates](how-to-invite-teammates) to join your project and manage the links together.

## How many domains can I add to a project?

You can [add as many domains](how-to-add-custom-domain) as you want to a project. If your project has multiple domains, you will be able to filter the links in the project by their respective domains.
