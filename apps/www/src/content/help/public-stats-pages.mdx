On Dub, you can create a public stats dashboard for your short links.

This allows you to share the stats for a given short link with clients or other external stakeholders without having to invite them to your Dub project.

## How to create a public stats page

1. On your Dub dashboard, click on the `ðŸ“Š clicks` button for a given short link to open the stats page.
2. Click on the **Share** button to open up the share dropdown menu.
3. Toggle the "Public Stats Page" switch to **ON**.

Behind the scenes, Dub creates a public page for your link's stats and automatically copies the link to your clipboard.

[Here's an example](https://dub.co/stats/github).

## How to disable a public stats page

Follow the same steps as above, but toggle the "Public Stats Page" switch to **OFF**.

Dub will automatically disable the public stats page for the given link. You will still be able to view the stats for the link on your Dub dashboard, but the public page will no longer be accessible.
