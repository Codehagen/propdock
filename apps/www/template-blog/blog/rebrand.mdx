Today, we're thrilled to announce our rebrand. **Dub.sh is now Dub.co**.

Almost a year ago, we [launched Dub to the world](introducing-dub). Since then, we've been growing steadily and recently surpassed the following milestones:

- **10,000+** users
- **1,000+** connected custom domains
- **30,000+** short links created
- **7.7 million** links redirected
- **10,000+** GitHub stars
- Powering teams like **Vercel**, **Tinybird**, **Hashnode**, and more.

We're incredibly grateful for the support and feedback we've received from our users. Thank you for being part of our journey.

## Our New Brand: Dub.co

As we grew, we realized that our existing brand, _Dub.sh_, was not ideal.

While it was great for short links, the relatively unfamiliar `.sh` TLD has been a point of confusion for many users. We've gotten feedback that the name looked suspicious – especially to a marketer who has never seen a `.sh` domain before. Furthermore, the `.sh` TLD is [blocked in certain regions](https://x.com/jr_resonable/status/1693666704990011744), which made it difficult for some users to access Dub without a VPN.

After months of brainstorming, we finally found the perfect name: **Dub.co**.

## What's new in Dub.co?

Our rebrand is more of a facelift than a complete overhaul. We're still the same Dub you know and love, but with a new domain. We will still be using `dub.sh` as the default short link domain on Dub, and all existing `dub.sh` links will continue to work as usual.

Along with our new brand, we've also been working on a multitude of new features and improvements. In the last 30 days, we rolled out 9 major updates:

<Changelog before={new Date("2023-08-20").toISOString()} count={9} />

## What's next?

We're very excited about the future of Dub. There are several features we're working on that we can't wait to share with you – more notably, [SAML/SSO](/help/category/saml-sso) and the [official Dub API](/help/article/dub-api).

Dub is here to stay and we're committed to making it the best link shortener for everyone, everywhere. We invite you to join us on this journey by [creating a free account](https://app.dub.co/register) today.
