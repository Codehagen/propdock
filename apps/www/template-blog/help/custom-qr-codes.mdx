<Note variant="success">
  This feature is only available for [Pro plans and above](pro-plan).
</Note>

As a freemium product, we rely on word of mouth to spread the word about Dub. Therefore, on Dub's free plan, you can only use the default QR code logo for your short links.

If you'd like to remove the Dub logo/upload your own, please consider [upgrading to a Pro plan](pro-plan#how-to-upgrade-to-pro) to support us. Thank you!

## How to set a custom QR Code logo?

Once you're on a Pro plan, you can set a custom QR code for your short links.

Your QR code logo is connected to your project's logo on Dub. To set a custom QR code, you'll need to set your project's logo first by following the steps below:

1. Go to your project settings page by clicking on the **Settings** link in the menu bar at the top of your project dashboard.
2. Scroll down to the **Project Logo** section and upload your company's logo. We recommend using a square image for the best results.

Once you've set your project's logo, your QR code will automatically update to use your project's logo.
