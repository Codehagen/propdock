When you add a custom domain to your project, Dub will automatically create a placeholder page for your domain. This page will be displayed when you visit your domain.

## Redirecting your domain

To redirect your domain to a URL of your choice, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, [upgrade to the Pro plan](pro-plan).
2. Navigate to your project's Domains page â€“ you can do that by clicking on the **Domains** link in the menu bar at the top of your project dashboard.
3. Click on the **Edit** button next to the domain you want to redirect to open up the Domain Settings modal.
4. Enter the URL you want to redirect your domain to in the **Landing Page** field.
5. Click "Save changes".

## Rewriting your domain (URL masking / cloaking)

In certain cases, you might want to rewrite your domain to a given URL (also known as URL masking or cloaking).

You can do that simply by setting the **Behavior** field of your custom domain to "Rewrite" in the Domain Settings modal:

A few caveats for the URL masking feature:

1. This feature is only available for [Pro plans and above](pro-plan).
2. URL masking might not work for certain websites that have security measures in place to prevent this (e.g. `twitter.com`). Potential errors include:
   - The domain redirects instead of rewriting
   - Domain keeps redirecting (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`)
3. For certain [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) websites, URL masking might cause broken CSS styles (e.g. `ray.so`)
