If you're using a domain on Cloudflare for your Dub project, you might need to configure a few extra steps to make sure that your domain works properly.

<Prerequisites>
  If you haven't already, you'll need to add your domain to your Dub project.
  You can learn how to do that [here](how-to-add-custom-domain).
</Prerequisites>

## Using Cloudflare's Proxy

If you're using Cloudflare's proxy for your custom domain, you'll need to make sure that your SSL/TLS encryption mode is set to "Full" on Cloudflare.

You can do that by following these steps:

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain.
2. Click on the **SSL/TLS** tab on the sidebar menu.
3. Under **Overview**, select the **Full** option.

This will make sure that the traffic to your domain is always encrypted between Cloudflare and Dub. You can learn more about Cloudflare's SSL/TLS encryption modes [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/).

## Using Cloudflare's DNS only (without proxy)

If you're only using Cloudflare's DNS for your custom domain, all you need to do is [set your domain's DNS records](how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) to point to Dub's servers and make sure that you're using the **DNS only** option on Cloudflare.

This will make sure that the traffic to your domain is _not proxied through Cloudflare_ and is sent directly to Dub. You can learn more about Cloudflare's proxy options [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169626-Identifying-network-ports-compatible-with-Cloudflare-s-proxy).
