[Migrating our time-series data to Tinybird](/changelog/tinybird-migration) earlier this year allowed us to scale our platform by magnitudes.

Thanks to that, we are increasing the limits of our Pro plan from 10,000 clicks per month to 50,000 clicks per month. We hope that this will let you grow your marketing further before having to upgrade to the next billing tier.

We have also sunsetted the previous [usage-based pricing model](https://twitter.com/dubdotco/status/1579466952594292737) and consolidated everything into the Pro plan.

Check out our [new pricing model](/pricing).
