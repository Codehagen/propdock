You can now search for the best thumbnail image for your short link using our new [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) integration.

This is a significant improvement to our [Custom Social Media Cards](/help/article/how-to-create-link#custom-social-media-cards) feature, which allows you to customize the title, description, and image of your short link when sharing on social media.

Alternatively, you can also paste a URL to an image of your choice or upload / drag-and-drop an image from your computer to use as the thumbnail image.

Check out a [demo](https://twitter.com/christer/status/1691087216335003648) of this feature.
