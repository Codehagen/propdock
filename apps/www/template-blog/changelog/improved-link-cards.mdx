We've improved the design of link cards on Dub to make them more readable – without sacrificing functionality.

The QR Code modal has been moved to the `⋮` dropdown on the right. It can also be accessed via the `q` keyboard shortcut.

The link creation timestamp has been converted to absolute timestamps (e.g. `Mar 26`) for links created more than 24 hours ago. This is similar to the way Twitter displays timestamps, and has better readability (as opposed to `110d ago`).

Shoutout to [Sean](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/263), [Alex](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/261), and [Jason](https://twitter.com/jasonlaster11) for the feedback!
