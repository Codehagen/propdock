We're improving the way you create tags on Dub.

Instead of a separate link tagging modal, we've combined it with the link creation flow. This makes it easier to create tags, and also allows you to add tags to your links as you create them.

Here's a [quick 2-min Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/f7c17d8bcaf443f2a971a620a3a3126f) explaining the difference between the old and new flows.

Shoutout to [Fazle](https://twitter.com/fazlerocks) from [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) for the [feature request](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/240)!
